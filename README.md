# Stop-Frisk-Analysis
This project was completed as a requirement for the Machine Learning course by Ravi Shroff and the Spatial Statistics course by Marc Scott.

“Stop-and-frisk” is a policy allowing police officers to stop, question, and frisk individuals who are suspected of being in the process of committing, having committed or about to commit a crime on the street at their discretion. In New York City, it has been used by the New York Police Department (NYPD) as a proactive policing strategy to identify suspicious behaviors and to combat crime since 2002. Proponents of the policy argue that it reduces crime at low cost; whereas critics question its constitutionality and charge that stop-and-frisk fails to respect civil rights by unfairly targeting certain racial, economic, sex, and age groups (Bellin & Jeffrey, 2014). Existing studies on stop-and-frisk focus on demographic attributes of people who are stopped, especially their race and age. Minority racial groups, particularly black and Hispanic people, are stopped disproportionately more frequently compared to white people, suggesting that the police tend to believe that racial minorities are more likely to commit crimes (Gelman et al., 2007). 


The goal of this project is twofold and will answer two different questions:

1) To build a model that will predict if a weapon on the suspect was actually found for those stop/frisk that were made by the NYPD for the suspicion of possesion of a weapon.
2) Whether stop rates (stops divided by population) were spatially correlated across census tracts and PUMA and b) how police activity in any given year might affect the frequency of stops in nearby areas in subsequent years (from 2010 to 2012)
a pattern of spatial clustering and how these patterns change over time.


The below view shows the number of stops that were made based on suspect posessing a weapon by race and by year. As seen below, the stops made in certain boroughs especially Staten Island reduce drastically
